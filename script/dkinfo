application shoud have to be start in bootstrap mode

first have to enable the approle

commond
vault auth enable approle

then create role

commond
vault write auth/approle/role/my-role \
     secret_id_ttl=100m \
     token_num_uses=10 \
     token_ttl=200m \
     token_max_ttl=300m \
     secret_id_num_uses=40 \
    policies=test-policy

note- above commond test-policy shoud have permission for the your secret application path 

for easy porpose i gave
polisy as 
path"*" {
    capabilities = ["read"]

}


then need to create the role id and secret-id 

commond for role id
vault read auth/approle/role/my-role/role-id

commond for secret id
vault write -f auth/approle/role/my-role/secret-id
